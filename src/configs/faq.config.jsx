          Every name on the BrandBucket marketplace is exclusively listed with
          BrandBucket. That means that all of our sellers are very responsive,
          making for quick domain transfers. A dedicated BrandBucket agent will
          manage your domain transfer from beginning to end, ensuring a secure
          and easy transaction. They will manage the receipt of the domain into
          one of BrandBucket’s secure registrar accounts and then complete the
          transfer to you.

        <p>
          The brandbucket lease-to-own program is available as an alternative to
          purchasing the name outright. You're able to buy the domain name with
          over monthly installments, and at the end of the lease period, if all
          payments are complete, you would be the new owner of the domain name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you complete the checkout process for a leased domain, you will
          be contacted by a BrandBucket agent who will help manage your lease.
          The domain will be transferred from the seller to a BrandBucket escrow
          account, ensuring a secure hold on the domain during the lease term.
          We will transfer the domain to you once all payments are complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the lease, you're entitled to use the domain name for your
          website and email; your agent will guide you through that. Each month
          you will continue to receive an invoice with a balance statement. You
          have the right to cancel the lease any time or complete all payments
          early to own the domain outright.

          Established in 2007, we are the original business name marketplace.
          Every year, we sell 1000s of premium domains to entrepreneurs and
          businesses like you.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our domain names are handpicked by branding and linguistics
          experts based on rigorous criteria. You can rest assured that if a
          domain is on the BrandBucket marketplace, it is a top-tier business
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost one out of every four names sold on BrandBucket is sold to a
          repeat buyer or a referral, which means that people who buy from us
          once, keep coming back for more.

          The .com extension is a brand in itself. As the default domain
          extension of the internet, having a .com domain that is an exact match
          to your brand name has numerous advantages:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2.5">
          <li>
            <span className="text-slate-600">Familiarity</span> - People are
            familiar with .com. Most of the brands and websites they already
            trust, use the .com extension. Therefore, it serves as a subtle
            indicator that your business is a legitimate one. A recent study by
            the NCC Group, a global expert in cybersecurity and risk mitigation,
            found that roughly half of the consumers are uncomfortable visiting
            websites ending with a non .com extension, and only 9% are
            comfortable doing so.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="text-slate-600">Brand Protection</span> - When you
            own the .com version of a domain name, you have the official online
            version of that name. Owning an exact-match .com can protect your
            brand name, as it is unlikely another serious business would use the
            same name when the .com extension is taken.

            <span className="text-slate-600">Easy to Communicate</span> - .com
            domains are also easy to communicate. When people hear or see your
            business name without a TLD, they will inevitably assume it ends in
            .com, making it easy for them to find you online.

          All of our business domains are carefully chosen for their standout
          branding qualities. There is only one cosmicmix.com. However, there
          may well be other businesses that are using the same brand name. In
          fact, with common keyword names, it is likely. That is why owning the
          .com is so essential. In holding the .com, you immediately establish
          your business as the most official version of that name. It's unlikely
          any serious business is going to use a brand name where the .com
          domain is already in use. Many companies believe that owning the
          matching .com version of a business name provides more protection for
          their brand than a trademark.

        <p>
          No, and it’s not possible for us to do so. Trademarks are industry and
          region-specific, and to file a trademark for a name or logo, you must
          already be doing business as that name. Because of this, we can't
          trademark a name before your company is actively using it. Therefore,
          you will need to apply for trademark registration after you have
          purchased the name.

        <p>
          When you purchase a domain from BrandBucket, you will own it 100%.
          However, all domain names worldwide must be kept registered at a
          registrar like Godaddy or similar that you choose. You will pay the
          registration fees to whichever registrar you decide to use. The price
          of registration varies at each registrar, but it generally ends up
          being around $10-15 per year for a .com domain name. Registration is
          annual but can be paid up for years in advance, which we suggest you
          do.
